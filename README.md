# HealthArchive.ca – Frontend (Next.js)

HealthArchive.ca is an independent, non-governmental project to preserve and surface
historical versions of **Canadian public health web content** (e.g., PHAC, Health Canada).

This repository contains the **Next.js frontend** for the public site at:

-   https://healtharchive.ca (production, early demo)
-   https://healtharchive.vercel.app (Vercel default domain)

> **Status:** Early demo  
> The UI now prefers live backend APIs for search, browse, and snapshot detail
> (configured via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`), and gracefully falls back to the
> bundled demo dataset when the API is unreachable.

## Tech stack

-   **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:**
    -   TailwindCSS for layout/spacing
    -   Custom `.ha-*` utility classes in `src/app/globals.css` for the design system
-   **Package manager:** npm
-   **Hosting:** Vercel

### Key UI/UX features

-   Sticky, scroll-aware header that gently condenses on scroll and uses a blurred, translucent background so it stays present without obscuring content.
-   Accessible light/dark theme toggle:
    -   Uses CSS variables and a `data-theme="light" | "dark"` attribute on `<html>`.
    -   Respects the user’s OS preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) on first load.
    -   Persists the user’s choice in `localStorage` for subsequent visits.
-   Shared `.ha-*` design system for cards, buttons, badges, and page shells to keep the site visually consistent.
    -   Header/nav: pill-style links with a sliding active indicator and a gradient underline on the brand mark that animates in-line with the metric bars.
    -   Homepage surfaces: `ha-home-hero` for card-like sections; `ha-home-hero-plain` to drop the gradient on follow-up sections; `ha-home-band-*` and `ha-home-panel` remain available for muted shells.
    -   Metrics: `ha-metric-*` helpers and animated bars used in the “Project snapshot” card.
    -   Audience/explainer sections: `ha-audience-*` helpers plus `ha-section-lede` for readable intro copy.
    -   CTA glow: `ha-btn-glow` with `HoverGlowLink` / `HoverGlowButton` provides a subtle cursor-follow highlight on primary/secondary actions.
    -   Hero before/after phrase includes a `<noscript>` fallback so the intended text remains clear for non-JS crawlers/users.
    -   Hero animation orchestration:
        -   `TrackChangesPhrase` dispatches `ha-trackchanges-finished` when the “before → after” typing sequence completes.
        -   The homepage “Project snapshot” metrics start on that event and then dispatch `ha-project-snapshot-finished` after both metrics complete, which triggers the final “before” removal.

## Getting started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure API base URL

The frontend talks to the backend via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`. If this is
unset, the client falls back to `http://localhost:8001`, which is convenient
for local development but **not** appropriate for staging/production.

For local development, create a `.env.local` (git-ignored) with:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` and set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001
```

On Vercel (staging/production), set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` via the Vercel
UI under **Settings → Environment Variables**. Recommended values:

| Environment | Frontend URL                       | Backend URL                                      | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Local       | `http://localhost:3000`            | `http://127.0.0.1:8001`                          | `http://127.0.0.1:8001`                |
| Preview     | `https://healtharchive.vercel.app` | `https://api-staging.healtharchive.ca` (or prod) | `https://api-staging.healtharchive.ca` |
| Production  | `https://healtharchive.ca` / `www` | `https://api.healtharchive.ca`                   | `https://api.healtharchive.ca`         |

> `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is still supported for backward-compatibility, but
> `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is the preferred and documented way to configure
> the API base.

### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 4. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

(In production, Vercel runs the build and serves the app.)

### 5. Lint (recommended)

```bash
npm run lint
```

### 6. Tests (mocked, no backend required)

```bash
npm test
```

Vitest + Testing Library with mocked fetch; no live backend needed.

### CI / deployment notes

-   A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`) runs on pushes
    to `main` and on pull requests:

    -   Installs dependencies via `npm ci`.
    -   Runs `npm run lint`.
    -   Runs `npm test` (Vitest + Testing Library with mocked fetch; no live backend
        required).
    -   Runs a lightweight dependency security audit:

        ```bash
        npm audit --audit-level=high
        ```

-   Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is set per environment (Vercel/staging/prod).
-   Optional diagnostics envs (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_API_HEALTH_BANNER`,
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_API_HEALTH_FAILURE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_API_BASE_HINT`) are
    normally disabled in CI and production to keep logs quiet.

## Backend integration overview

-   Data sources:
    -   Live APIs (preferred): `/api/search`, `/api/sources`, `/api/snapshot/{id}`, `/api/snapshots/raw/{id}`, `/api/health`.
    -   Demo fallback: bundled sample records under `src/data/demo-records.ts` and static snapshots under `public/demo-archive/**` when the API is unavailable.
-   API client: `src/lib/api.ts` (uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, defaulting to `http://localhost:8001`).
-   Production backend: single Hetzner VPS (Nuremberg) running Postgres + API + worker + Caddy; SSH is Tailscale-only; public ports are 80/443 only. Full runbook lives in `healtharchive-backend/docs/production-single-vps.md`.
-   Pages:
    -   `/archive`: uses backend search with pagination and page-size selection; falls back to demo data and shows a fallback notice.
    -   `/archive/browse-by-source`: uses backend source summaries; falls back to demo summaries with a notice.
    -   `/snapshot/[id]`: fetches backend snapshot detail/raw URL first; falls back to demo record/static snapshot if needed. The viewer shows a loading overlay and a friendly error state if the iframe fails.
-   Health diagnostics (optional): set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_API_HEALTH_BANNER=true` to surface a small banner when the backend health check fails (useful in dev/staging).
    -   If the health banner is off, you can still log failures by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_API_HEALTH_FAILURE=true` (dev-only).
-   Topics/sources: topic dropdown and source options come from the backend when
    available. Topics use backend‑provided `{slug, label}` pairs (slug in query
    params, label in the UI); demo mode slugifies labels internally to mimic the
    same contract.

### Pre-release smoke (recommended)

-   Search (`/archive`): keywords + source/topic filters, pagination (First/Prev/Next/Last), page-size selector.
-   Browse by source (`/archive/browse-by-source`): cards load with counts/topics.
-   Snapshot (`/snapshot/[id]`): metadata present; iframe loads or shows error overlay with raw/API links; missing ID returns notFound.
-   Some API calls happen server-side in Next.js; if you don’t see requests in the browser Network tab, tail backend logs or call the API directly to confirm connectivity.
-   Topics/sources: topic dropdown and source options come from the backend when
    available, with topics using `{slug, label}` from the API. In demo mode,
    labels are slugified client‑side so the UI can keep using topic slugs in
    URLs.

This runs the Next.js/ESLint config for the app.

## Deployment

Production is managed via Vercel:

-   GitHub repo: [https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive-frontend](https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive-frontend)
-   Production branch: `main`
-   Domains:

    -   `healtharchive.ca` (apex, A record → Vercel IP)
    -   `www.healtharchive.ca` (CNAME → Vercel DNS host)
    -   `healtharchive.vercel.app` (default Vercel URL)

Any push to `main` triggers a new Vercel deployment.
