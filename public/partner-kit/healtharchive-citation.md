# HealthArchive.ca - Citation handout

Purpose: A consistent, citation-ready way to reference HealthArchive snapshots and compare views.

These citations refer to archived content, not current guidance or medical advice.

---

## 1) Cite a snapshot

Recommended format:

HealthArchive.ca Project. "<Page title>" (snapshot from <capture date/time>). Archived copy of <source organization> web page (<original URL>). Accessed <access date>. Available from: <HealthArchive snapshot URL>.

Example:

HealthArchive.ca Project. "COVID-19 epidemiology update: Canada" (snapshot from 2025-02-15 00:00 UTC). Archived copy of Public Health Agency of Canada web page (https://www.canada.ca/...). Accessed 2025-12-03. Available from: https://www.healtharchive.ca/snapshot/12345.

Notes:

- Use the exact snapshot URL you visited.
- Use the capture timestamp shown on the snapshot page (UTC).
- Always cite the original URL as well.

---

## 2) Cite a compare view

Compare views highlight descriptive text differences between two archived captures of the same page.

Recommended format:

HealthArchive.ca Project. "Comparison of archived captures" (from snapshot <ID A> to snapshot <ID B>). Archived copies of <source organization> web page (<original URL>). Accessed <access date>. Available from: https://www.healtharchive.ca/compare?from=<ID A>&to=<ID B>.

Notes:

- Compare output is descriptive only and does not interpret meaning.
- Always record both snapshot IDs and the capture timestamps shown on the compare page.
