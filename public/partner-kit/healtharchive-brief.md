# HealthArchive.ca - One-page brief

HealthArchive.ca is an independent, non-governmental archive of selected Canadian public health web pages.

It preserves time-stamped snapshots so researchers, journalists, and educators can cite what a public website displayed at a specific point in time, even if the page later changes or disappears.

This is an archival record and change-tracking tool. It is not current guidance or medical advice.
