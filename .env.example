# Local development defaults. Copy to .env.local (git-ignored) and adjust as needed.

# Base URL for the backend API. If unset, the client falls back to
# http://localhost:8001, which is fine for quick local experiments but should
# not be relied on in staging/production.

# Local dev example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001

# Staging example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.healtharchive.ca

# Production example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.healtharchive.ca

# Dev/staging diagnostics (optional). These should normally remain *false* in
# production and CI to avoid noisy logs:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_API_HEALTH_BANNER=true
# NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_API_HEALTH_FAILURE=true
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_API_BASE_HINT=true

# Never put admin or other secret tokens in NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars; anything
# prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ is exposed to browser JavaScript.
