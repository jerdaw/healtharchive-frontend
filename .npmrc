# eslint-plugin-react@7.37.5 declares eslint@^9.7 as a peer dep but works fine
# with eslint 10 after the patch in patches/eslint-plugin-react+7.37.5.patch.
# Remove this (and related scaffolding) once eslint-plugin-react ships eslint 10
# support upstream. See https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive-frontend/issues/67
