      <h2>What is HealthArchive.ca?</h2>
      <p>
        HealthArchive.ca is an independent, non-governmental archive of Canadian public health information.
        We use modern web archiving tools to capture, store, and replay snapshots of key public health websites,
        starting with federal sources such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        Government websites are living documents: pages move, content changes, and dashboards appear and disappear.
        Our goal is to provide transparent, verifiable access to previously-public health information, not to replace
        official guidance or offer medical advice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="ha-section" id="methods">
      <h2>How this will work</h2>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li><strong>Capture:</strong> Browser-based crawlers archive public-facing pages on Canadian public health websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Preserve:</strong> Archived content is stored in standard web archive formats designed for long-term preservation.</li>
        <li><strong>Replay:</strong> An archive explorer will allow users to search and view past versions of pages, with clear timestamps and source information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        Detailed technical documentation and coverage notes will be published as the project moves from prototype to production.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="ha-section" id="status">
      <h2>Project status</h2>
      <p>
        HealthArchive.ca is currently in an early pilot phase. Our immediate priorities are:
      </p>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li>Defining the initial list of federal public health sources and domains.</li>
        <li>Building and testing the archiving and replay infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Publishing transparent documentation of methods, scope, and limitations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        This landing page and demo search experience are previews of the project. The public archive explorer will be released once core infrastructure is stable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="ha-section" id="researchers">
      <h2>For researchers</h2>
      <p>
        HealthArchive.ca is being designed so that epidemiologists, health services researchers, policy analysts,
        and data journalists can reliably reconstruct what Canadian public health sites showed at specific points in time.
        Even in this early demo phase, we want the research use case to be clear.
      </p>

      <h3>Use cases this archive aims to support</h3>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Policy and guideline history:</strong> Identifying how public health guidance for topics like COVID-19,
          influenza vaccination, or naloxone distribution has changed over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reproducibility of analyses:</strong> Linking an analysis to the exact wording and tables that were visible
          on a given date, rather than the current version of a page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Media and communication studies:</strong> Examining how risk communication, disclaimers, or emphasis on
          specific populations evolved across different periods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audit and accountability work:</strong> Comparing archived content with later messaging to understand
          shifts in emphasis, framing, or scope.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Working with the demo archive</h3>
      <p>
        The current demo offers:
      </p>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li>
          A small, curated set of example records from public-facing Canadian federal health sites (e.g., PHAC, Health Canada),
          represented in <code>data/demo-records.json</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A simple search interface (<a href="search.html">search.html</a>) that lets you query the demo index by keywords and topics.
        </li>
        <li>
          A “browse by source” view (<a href="browse.html">browse.html</a>) summarizing which sources and topics appear in the demo records.
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML “snapshot” stubs under <code>demo-archive/</code> that stand in for actual archived pages
          and show how replay URLs will be structured.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        In the live system, these demo pieces will be replaced by a real index and replay service backed by WARC files and
        dedicated storage. The goal is that any URL surfaced in search or browse can be opened in an archive viewer with
        a clearly-labelled capture timestamp.
      </p>

      <h3>Citing HealthArchive.ca</h3>
      <p>
        Until formal citation guidance is published, a pragmatic format for referencing an archived page from HealthArchive.ca is:
      </p>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        <em>
          HealthArchive.ca Project. “&lt;Page title&gt;” (snapshot from &lt;capture date&gt;). Archived copy of
          &lt;original agency&gt; web page (&lt;original URL&gt;). Accessed &lt;access date&gt;. Available from:
          &lt;HealthArchive.ca archived URL&gt;.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, for a COVID-19 epidemiology update snapshot, a citation might look like:
      </p>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        <em>
          HealthArchive.ca Project. “COVID-19 epidemiology update: Canada” (snapshot from 15 Feb 2025). Archived copy of
          Public Health Agency of Canada web page (https://www.canada.ca/...). Accessed 3 Dec 2025. Available from:
          https://healtharchive.ca/demo-archive/phac/2025-02-15-covid-epi.html.
        </em>
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations and interpretation</h3>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Not official guidance:</strong> Archived content reflects what public sites showed at capture time.
          It may be incomplete, outdated, or superseded, and should not be treated as current clinical guidance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sampling and coverage:</strong> Early phases will focus on specific high-value domains and paths.
          Coverage gaps and known limitations will be documented so researchers can correctly interpret what “absence”
          of an archived page means.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical artefacts:</strong> Some interactive dashboards, embedded visualizations, or third-party assets
          may not replay perfectly due to JavaScript, API, or hosting constraints.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Planned researcher-focused capabilities (not yet implemented)</h3>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li>
          Snapshot-level version history for individual URLs, exposing a timeline of captures for each page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Side-by-side comparison views to highlight textual changes between two archived snapshots.
        </li>
        <li>
          Machine-readable exports (e.g., JSON/CSV) describing changes over time for selected URLs or topics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightweight APIs for programmatic querying of snapshot metadata, with rate limits and sustainability in mind.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        These features are part of the planned roadmap but are deliberately not implemented in this early frontend demo.
        They will be documented in detail before any research-facing API or export features go live.
