          HealthArchive.ca is a volunteer-led project preserving snapshots of key Canadian public
          health websites, so clinicians, researchers, journalists, and the public can see what
          was published even after it changes or disappears.

      <h2>What is HealthArchive.ca?</h2>
      <p>
        HealthArchive.ca is an independent, non-governmental archive of Canadian public health information.
        We use modern web archiving tools to capture, store, and replay snapshots of key public health websites,
        starting with federal sources such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        Government websites are living documents: pages move, content changes, and dashboards appear and disappear.
        Our goal is to provide transparent, verifiable access to previously-public health information, not to replace
        official guidance or offer medical advice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="ha-section" id="methods">
      <h2>How this will work</h2>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li><strong>Capture:</strong> We use browser-based crawlers to archive public-facing pages on Canadian public health websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Preserve:</strong> Archived content is stored in standard web archive formats designed for long-term preservation.</li>
        <li><strong>Replay:</strong> An archive explorer will allow users to search and view past versions of pages, with clear timestamps and source information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        Detailed technical documentation and coverage notes will be published as the project moves from prototype to production.
      </p>

    <section class="ha-section" id="status">
      <h2>Project status</h2>
      <p>
        HealthArchive.ca is currently in an early pilot phase. Our immediate priorities are:
      </p>
      <ul class="ha-list">
        <li>Defining the initial list of federal public health sources and domains.</li>
        <li>Building and testing the archiving and replay infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Publishing transparent documentation of methods, scope, and limitations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ha-muted">
        This landing page is a preview of the project. The public archive explorer will be released once core infrastructure is stable.
